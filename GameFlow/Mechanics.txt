Movement:
    smooth
    easy to control
    not many  bindings

I want this game to have a mechanic that seems a little out of the players control
maybe seems like the player cannot control it as easily
movement with little less friction
out of player's control feel

Bindings:
    A           Left
    D           Right
    Space       Jump
    leftMouse   Use
    Tab         Show Stats

See what I mean
Literally 5 bindings
