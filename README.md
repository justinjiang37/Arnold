# **Arnold**

### **Description**
I would like to describe "Arnold" as more of an experience than a game. It describes an average working-class man's life. The game starts off with Arnold getting a new job, he is happy and confident, his wife and kids are also thankful and everything seems perfect. However, this does not seem to progress as his 9-5 job weighs more and more stress on him. He and his family starts to go through hard ship it is up to you to help Arnold push through.

### **Game Play**
It is extremely easy to control Arnold. As this is more of an experience than a puzzle or action game, there will only be 5 bidings for you to learn.

The game sets in a 3-D platform with Arnold roaming through each scene of his day from left to right.

You will choose what and when he interact with certain objects which will in return have an affect on his Mental Health Statistic Bar shown with the TAB button in game.

His mood, behaviour, and people around his will change based on this Bar so beware of what you do!

### **Key Features**
-  Singleplayer
-  Immersive Audio
- Player Controlled Out Come
- Reactable AI

### **Disclamers**
This game bears no resemblense to any country or a certain group of people.
This games purpose is to help me to learn more about game development and to spread awareness about working-class stress. I have seen real people that live through their 9-5 job everyday desperately. Do what you love, dont be an Arnold.
